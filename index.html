                    media (for example, the Harry Potter series) are common, and the players involved tend to overlap

       <h3>Play-by-Post Games: Current Status</h3><br>
       <div class="col-md-6">
           
           <p style="font-size:1.5em;">Rather than following gameplay in real-time, players post messages on such media as bulletin boards,
               online forums, Chatrooms (such as
               like AOL, hangouts and Yahoo chat) and mailing lists to which their fellow players will post role- played
               responses without a real limit or timeframe.
               Of late such blogging tools and sites
               as LiveJournal have been utilized for this purpose. This includes such games as play-by-
               email (or PBEM) RPGs. The origins of this style of role-playing are unknown, but it most likely
               originated in some form during the mid-to-late 1980s.</p></div>
               <div class="col-md-6">
               <p style="font-size:1.5em;">Typically, a game master (Admin) is tasked not only with world creation, but
                   trying to set up their
                   unique play-post-game within the bounds of whatever platform they have chosen.
                   This most often happens on forum software like myBB or phpBB -- although alternative platforms, such
                   as Reddit, Wordpress, Facebook, Tumblr, and Skype are also frequently used, due to the knowledge
                   needed to set up and run the aforementioned forum software.
                   <p style="font-size:1.5em;">The anatomy of a PBP-RPG dictates that each post comes from a different character. Characters all
                   have attributes such as class (eg, Vampire), personality, history, abilities, and the list can go on.
                   Add to this a universal story setting, world constraints, individual timelines, any character or
                   world events... and you could see how this would quickly get overwhelming to keep track of, for both
                   players and Admin alike.</p>

                    different character aliases.

                    sub-areas, threads and posts.

                            Profiles (also known as Character Sheets) would be tied to each account. These could be
                            expanded upon and easily customized by the admin. This would make keeping track of character
                            attributes much easier.

        <div data-aos="zoom-in" class="col-md-7"><p>Boozhoo! Nice to meet you! My name is Shadia Ursula. I am a full stack web developer who is passionate about bringing
        ideas to life - from conceptualization to creation. I graduated with a diploma in Interactive Media Design in 2019, and
        I am currently studying Interactive Media Specialist at Fanshawe's downtown campus.<br>
        
        I've been enthusiastic about web development and design from a young age: in my spare time in grade-school you could
        find me in the library learning HTML4 and CSS2. Although I've progressed a bit beyond that by now, the desire to create
        still holds strong. I am a critical thinker who is always driven to learn more - because I believe learning is a
        lifelong process.</p></div>
